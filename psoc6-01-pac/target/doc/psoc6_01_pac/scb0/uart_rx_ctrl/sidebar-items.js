initSidebarItems({"struct":[["BREAK_WIDTH_R","Field `BREAK_WIDTH` reader - Break width. BREAK_WIDTH + 1 is the minimum width in bit periods of a break. During a break the transmitted/received line value is ‘0’. This feature is useful for standard UART submode and LIN submode (‘break field’ detection). Once, the break is detected, the INTR_RX.BREAK_DETECT bit is set to ‘1’. Note that break detection precedes baud rate detection, which is used to synchronize/refine the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. As a result, break detection operates with an unsynchronized/unrefined receiver clock. Therefore, the receiver’s definition of a bit period is imprecise and the setting of this field should take this imprecision into account. The LIN standard also accounts for this imprecision: a LIN start bit followed by 8 data bits allows for up to 9 consecutive ‘0’ bit periods during regular transmission, whereas the LIN break detection should be at least 13 consecutive ‘0’ bit periods. This provides for a margin of 4 bit periods. Therefore, the default value of this field is set to 10, representing a minimal break field with of 10+1 = 11 bit periods; a value in between the 9 consecutive bit periods of a regular transmission and the 13 consecutive bit periods of a break field. This provides for slight imprecisions of the receiver clock wrt. the transmitter clock. There should not be a need to program this field to any value other than its default value."],["BREAK_WIDTH_W","Field `BREAK_WIDTH` writer - Break width.
