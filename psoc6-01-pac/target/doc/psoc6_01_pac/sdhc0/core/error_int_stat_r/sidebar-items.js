The error could be due to following reasons: - Error response received from System bus (Master I/F) - ADMA3,ADMA2 Descriptors invalid - CQE Task or Transfer descriptors invalid When the error occurs, the state of the ADMA is saved in the ADMA Error Status register. In eMMC CQE mode: The Host Controller generates this Interrupt when it detects an invalid descriptor data (Valid=0) at the ST_FDS state. ADMA Error State in the ADMA Error Status indicates that an error has occurred in ST_FDS state. The Host Driver may find that Valid bit is not set at the error descriptor.
