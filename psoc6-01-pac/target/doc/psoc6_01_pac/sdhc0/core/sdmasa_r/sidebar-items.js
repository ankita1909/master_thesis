Reading this register during data transfers may return an invalid value. - 32-bit Block Count (Host Version 4 Enable = 1): From the Host Controller Version 4.10 specification, this register is redefined as 32-bit Block Count. The Host Controller decrements the block count of this register for every block transfer and the data transfer stops when the count reaches zero. This register must be accessed when no transaction is executing. Reading this register during data transfers may return invalid value.
