This bit is a copy of LS_EN that is synchronized to the low speed clock domain and back to the system clock domain. Firmware can use this bit to observe whether LS_EN has taken effect in the low speed clock domain. Firmware should never change the configuration for the LS generator without ensuring this bit is 0. The following procedure should be followed to disable the LS generator: 1. If LS_EN=0 we are done. Exit the procedure. 2. Check that LS_EN_STAT=1. If not, wait until it is. This will catch the case of a recent enable (LS_EN=1) that has not taken effect yet. 3. Set LS_EN=0. 4.
