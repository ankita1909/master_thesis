The FLL requires firmware sequencing when enabling, disabling, and entering/exiting DEEPSLEEP. To enable the FLL, first enable the CCO by writing CLK_FLL_CONFIG4.CCO_ENABLE=1 and wait until CLK_FLL_STATUS.CCO_READY==1. Next, ensure the reference clock has stabilized and CLK_FLL_CONFIG3.BYPASS_SEL=FLL_REF. Next, write FLL_ENABLE=1 and wait until CLK_FLL_STATUS.LOCKED==1. Finally, write CLK_FLL_CONFIG3.BYPASS_SEL=FLL_OUT to switch to the FLL output. It takes seven reference clock cycles plus four FLL output cycles to switch to the FLL output. Do not disable the FLL before this time completes. To disable the FLL, write CLK_FLL_CONFIG3.BYPASS_SEL=FLL_REF and (optionally) read the same register to ensure the write completes. Then, wait at least seven FLL reference clock cycles before disabling it with FLL_ENABLE=0. Lastly, disable the CCO by writing CLK_FLL_CONFIG4.CCO_ENABLE=0. Before entering DEEPSLEEP, either disable the FLL using above sequence or use the following procedure to deselect/select it before/after DEEPSLEEP. Before entering DEEPSLEEP, write CLK_FLL_CONFIG3.BYPASS_SEL=FLL_REF to change the FLL to use its reference clock.
